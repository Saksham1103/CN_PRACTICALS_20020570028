      <h1>Practical 1 : Simulate and implement go back n sliding window protocol</h1>
      <p1>Go-Back-N protocol is a data link layer protocol that uses a sliding window method for reliable and sequential delivery of data frames. It is a case of sliding window protocol having to send window size of N and receiving window size of 1. If we have five frames and the concept is Go-Back-3, which means that the three frames can be sent, i.e., frame 1, frame 2, frame 3, can be sent before expecting the acknowledgement of frame 1.</p1>
      <h2>Practical 2 : Simulate Cyclic Renundancy Check(CRC) error detection algorithm for noisy channel</h2>
      <p2>A Cyclic Renundancy Check(CRC) is an error-detecting code commonly used in digital networks and storage devices to detct accidental changes to raw data. It uses generator polynomial which is available on both sender and receiver side. In the practical I have used 5 functions.... 1) function for crc check , 2) helper function to get reminder by dividing data with polynomial , 3) function to get substring of a data frame , 4) function to check whether the received data is correct or not , 5) function to simulate network.</p2>
